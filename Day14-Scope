The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a-b| .
The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference
between any two integers in elements .

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing  
N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

1. A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
2. A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in N and stores
it in the maximumDifference instance variable.

Solution:

      public int[] getElements() {
        return elements;
    }

    public void setElements(int[] elements) {
        this.elements = elements;
    }

    public Difference(int[] elements) {
        setElements(elements);
    }

    public int computeDifference() {
        int [] array = Difference.this.getElements();
        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        for (int i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
            list.add(array[i]);
            }
        int min = Collections.min(list);
        int max = Collections.max(list);
        maximumDifference = Math.abs(max-min);
        return maximumDifference;
    }
