Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

Solution:



        int i2;
        double d2;
        String s2 = "";

        /* Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.*/
        i2 = scan.nextInt();
        d2 = scan.nextDouble();
        String f = scan.nextLine();
        s2 = scan.nextLine();

        // Note: If you have trouble reading the entire String, please go back and review the Tutorial closely.
        
        /* Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line. */
        int i3 = i+i2;
        double d3 = d+d2;
        String s3 = s+s2;

        System.out.println(i3);
        /* Print the sum of the double variables on a new line. */
        System.out.println(d3);
        /* Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line; 
            the 's' variable above should be printed first. */
        System.out.println(s3);
        /* Declare second integer, double, and String variables. */

        /* Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.*/
        // Note: If you have trouble reading the entire String, please go back and review the Tutorial closely.

        /* Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line. */

        /* Print the sum of the double variables on a new line. */
		
        /* Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line; 
        	the 's' variable above should be printed first. */
