Problem:

Objective
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1 , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated
strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index. 

Solution:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
        public static void stampaCaract(String S) {
        String toStamp1 = "";
        String toStamp2 = "";
        for (int i=0; i<S.length(); i++) {
            if (i%2 ==0) {
                char charS = S.charAt(i);
                toStamp1 += charS;
            }
            else {
                char charS = S.charAt(i);
                toStamp2 += charS;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(toStamp1+" "+toStamp2);
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
        int nInput = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i=0; i<nInput; i++) {
            String myString = scanner.next();
            Solution.stampaCaract(myString);
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
