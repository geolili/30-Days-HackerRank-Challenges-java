Problem:

Objective
Today we're discussing Generics; be aware that not all languages support this construct, so fewer languages are enabled for this challenge.
Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter
(the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

Note: You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.



    /**
    *    Method Name: printArray
    *    Print each element of the generic array on a new line. Do not return anything.
    *    @param A generic array
    **/
    
    // Write your code here
    public void printArray(T [] array) {
        for (int i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(array[i]);
        }
    }
