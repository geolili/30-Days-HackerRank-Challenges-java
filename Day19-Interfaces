Objective
Today, we're learning about Interfaces. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
The AdvancedArithmetic interface and the method declaration for the abstract divisorSum(n) method
are provided for you in the editor below.

Complete the implementation of Calculator class, which implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface.
The implementation for the divisorSum(n) method must return the sum of all divisors of n.

Solution:


class Calculator implements AdvancedArithmetic {
    public int divisorSum(int n) {
        int sum=0;
        for (int i=1;i<=n;i++) {
            if (n%i==0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
