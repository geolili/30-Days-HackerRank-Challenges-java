Problem:

Objective
Today, we're working with Binary Search Trees (BSTs). Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf.
You are given a pointer,root , pointing to the root of a binary search tree.
Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns the height of the binary search tree.

Solution:



	public static int getHeight(Node root){
      //Write your code here
        if (root == null) {
            return -1;
        } else {
        return 1 + Math.max(getHeight(root.left), getHeight(root.right));
        }
    }
