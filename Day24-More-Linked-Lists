Task
A Node class is provided for you in the editor. A Node object has an integer data field, data, and a Node instance pointer, next, 
pointing to another node (i.e.: the next node in a list).

A removeDuplicates function is declared in your editor, which takes a pointer to the head node of a linked list as a parameter.
Complete removeDuplicates so that it deletes any duplicate nodes from the list and returns the head of the updated list.

Note: The head pointer may be null, indicating that the list is empty.
Be sure to reset your next pointer when performing deletions to avoid breaking the list.

Solution:



    public static Node removeDuplicates(Node head) {
      //Write your code here
      Node currentNode = head;
       while(currentNode!=null && currentNode.next!=null)
           {
           Node node = currentNode;
           while(node.next!=null)
               {
               if(node.next.data==currentNode.data)
                   {
                   Node next = node.next.next;
                   Node temp= node.next;
                   node.next=next;
                   temp=null;

               }
               else{
               node=node.next;
               }
           }
           currentNode=currentNode.next;
       }
       return head;
    }
