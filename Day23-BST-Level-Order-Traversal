Problem:

Objective
Today, we're going further with Binary Search Trees. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. 
You are given a pointer, root, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the levelOrder function provided
in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

Hint: You'll find a queue helpful in completing this challenge.

Solution:



static void levelOrder(Node root){
      //Write your code here
              if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        Queue<Node> nodes = new LinkedList<>();
        nodes.add(root);
        while (!nodes.isEmpty()) {
             
            Node node = nodes.remove();
     
            System.out.print(node.data+" ");
     
            if (node.left != null) {
                nodes.add(node.left);
            }
     
            if (node.right!= null) {
                nodes.add(node.right);
            }
        }
    }
